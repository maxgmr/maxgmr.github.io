<p>I'm Max Gilmourâ€” welcome to my personal website.</p>
<p>
  I like to learn about things. Some of my favourite topics are systems
  programming, open-source software, languages, theology, and the philosophy of
  mind. In my spare time, I enjoy painting miniatures and spending time with my
  loved ones.
</p>
<p>
  I am a software developer and I work on personal projects in my own time.
  While most of my work is currently in Rust and TypeScript, I'm comfortable
  using many other languages when needed.
</p>
<p>
  I am a graduate of the Cognitive Systems - Computational Intelligence and
  Design program at the University of British Columbia. I currently reside in
  Victoria, BC, Canada.
