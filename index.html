<p>I'm Max Gilmourâ€” welcome to my personal website.</p>
<p>
  I like to learn about things. Some of my favourite topics are languages,
  theology, and the philosophy of mind. In my spare time, I enjoy painting
  miniatures and spending time with my loved ones.
</p>
<p>
  I am a software developer and I work on personal projects in my own time.
  While most of my work is currently in Rust & TypeScript, I'm comfortable using
  many other languages when needed.
</p>
<p>
  I am a graduate of the Cognitive Systems - Computational Intelligence and
  Design program at the University of British Columbia. I currently reside in
  Victoria, BC, Canada.
</p>
<p>This website is perpetually under construction, just like all of us are.</p>
