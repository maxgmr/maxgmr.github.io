A simple program, inspired by the [GNU Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/), which allows for quick command-line conversion to and from decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary notation. It utilises the standard streams for input and output, so it can be used in conjunction with any other command-line utilities.
